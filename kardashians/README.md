# Up and Down With the Kardashians

<p>While I'm not a fan nor a hater of the Kardashians and Jenners, the polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns to content.</p>
<p>The sisters in particular over the past decade have been especially productive in this regard. Let's get some facts straight. I consider the "sisters" to be the following daughters of Kris Jenner. Three from her first marriage to lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kardashian">Robert Kardashian</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian">Kourtney Kardashian</a> (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1979)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1980)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khlo%C3%A9_Kardashian">Khlo√© Kardashian</a> (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1984)</li>
</ul>
<p>And two from her second marriage to Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> (formerly Bruce):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner">Kendall Jenner</a> (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1995)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1997)</li>
</ul>

<p>This family tree can be confusing, but we aren't here to explain it. We're here to explore the data underneath the hype, and we'll do it using search interest data from Google Trends. We'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of our own. And we'll answer the big question: <strong>is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?</strong></p>
<p>First, let's load and inspect our Google Trends data, which was downloaded in CSV form. The <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2007-01-01%202019-03-21&q=%2Fm%2F0261x8t,%2Fm%2F043p2f2,%2Fm%2F043ttm7,%2Fm%2F05_5_yx,%2Fm%2F05_5_yh">query</a> parameters: each of the sisters, worldwide search data, 2007 to present day. (2007 was the year Kim became "active" according to Wikipedia.)</p>
